# StarWarsChars

- This a task for week two of the Node stack. Here we are expected to create a front end application using html, CSS and JavaScript. That shows all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people/)

# TODO

- Displayed a dummy image for all single characters.

- Made a HTTP request to populate the frontend application. (Used Axios for the HTTP request call)

- Display a list with the names of each person from the API request.

- Click on any name, to display the details of that user on the screen, with name, gender, height only.

- Created a Class User with user property that takes in single user details and returns the details. (modelling spec for data) 

- All implementations are done using ES6.
